        <h2>Week 2 - Internet History</h2>

        <div class="question">
            Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your own liking. 
            Based on the events described in the reading, how would you do it? Would you need any funding to achieve the changes you seek? 
            How much? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain? 
            What does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?
        </div>
        <br>

        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            If I went back in time to the 1970s, I would make it so that the military wouldn't at first gatekeep the internet for war purpose and instead 
            focus on building communities online, kinda like how the hippies wanted it to be. I believe social progress (ex: BIPOC rights, women and LGBTQ+ rights, etc. )
            could accelerated if people could communicate online and share information not only by email but also with the help of forums or social medias. Of course, 
            the opposite can also happen, like we can see with in the news nowadays, but I still think it’s a net positive. If the internet was accessible to the public 
            earlier, it’d be easier for people to be aware of what’s happening around the world and be more empathetic of each other. It’d also be nice to be able to 
            share music and videos online so that events of the past are better preserved. Funding would be necessary for a project of that scale, but we should avoid 
            lobbying from any particular organization if possible. Ideally, Internet should be free for everyone. Perhaps a part of our taxes could be used to finance 
            the maintenance and the development of this technology (but then again, I have little to no knowledge in how our economy works). Personally, I believe that 
            big changes in history aren’t only caused by one individual. That’s a narrow way of seeing things and completely neglects to mention the small steps that 
            were done by countless other people through time. Especially since the important history in our textbooks tend to be very western and male centric. 
        </p>

        <h2>Week 3 - Global Networks</h2>

        <div class="question">
            You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, 
            videogame platforms, etc are currently provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country to your South, where they keep all their 
            servers. These companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of your country, and are so powerful and well-funded 
            that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island are able to compete with them. You’ve been hired by the government to help create a thriving local tech 
            economy and re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be owned by the monopoly conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution but is now 
            available to be put to the service of your fellow citizens however you propose it be.
            What is your proposed course of action?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            Essentially, I would do something similar to the Detroit Free Mesh Network project. I would bring together willing members of our community to work on our own
            network infrastructure. I would educate them on how this technology functions and its history so to no repeat the same problem as before. Ideally, we would 
            open a school to teach the most people possible and give a scholarship to especially bright students to encourage them to pursue their education. It would 
            certainly take a lot of work, but humans have shown many time their resourcefulness in situation of need. We would have to make sure that the power doesn’t 
            only fall in one single hand (AKA a monopoly conglomerate) and is closely regulated so they won’t be able to take advantage of their workers. Internet should 
            be principally made by the citizens of North Turtle for the citizens of North Turtle. Public spaces, like libraries or the mall should have internet available
            for people who can’t afford it. Perhaps we could do something like Hydro-Québec and nationalize our network and thus create a stronger economy for our country. 
            As time goes, other online services could be offered from the island itself by hiring local informaticians and programmers.
        </p>

        <h2>Week 4 - Internet Art</h2>

        <div class="question">
            What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet? What defines success as an artist, in your view? By that 
            metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you think are successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know 
            about?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            I think that early internet artists were motivated by the fact that it’s something brand-new, chaotic, and easily sharable. It was a place of freedom; people could 
            discuss about whatever they want and form communities without being pressured to make something commercially successful. It had the particularity of being interactive, 
            instantaneous, and immaterial, which makes it unique from other types of art. For many, it is a way to rebel ourselves against the rigid rules and bureaucracy surrounding 
            the traditional art institution. It can easily be used to spread a social or political message since anyone from the world can access to it.
            <br><br>
            To me, what defines success as an artist is when someone feels happy practicing their art and is willing to challenge themselves at their own rhythm. It is when someone manages 
            to express themselves freely and evoke some emotions and/or reactions by sharing that art. An artist doesn’t have to be super famous or make a fortune to be successful although 
            it is not a sin to want a reasonable income for all their hard work. I’d say that these artists are pretty successful in that regard, they managed to express themselves by using 
            the internet and raise some feelings and/or reactions.
            <br><br>
            Some of my favorite pieces of Internet arts are the collaborative ones, like for example the reddit r/Place canvas where people around the world can create art by placing one 
            pixel at the time by working together. I also like the SCP foundation website, which is a collaborative fiction project about a secret organization documenting various supernatural phenomena.

        <h2>Week 5 - Knowledge Sharing and Digital Media Interfaces</h2>

        <div class="question">
            It is the year 2030 and you’re hired at Concordia University to teach an interactive multimedia course named “Creative Computing & Network Culture”. You have all the technologies of digital media and network computing described in the readings at your disposal to design the most engaging educational experience ever created for your students, and serve as an example of good pedagogy to the entire world. Describe what you create.
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            The main problem with our educational system is that it is all too rigid, too bureaucratic, too productivity focused. It destroys the student’s natural curiosity, enthusiasm, and confidence by forcing them to follow a strict curriculum.
            <br><br>
            If I was a teacher for the Creative Computing & Network Culture, I would make it so that my students have more freedom to do their own research and then share it with others. I would create an interactive and collaborative platform similar to Wikipedia where they could create their own articles and give commentary on other people’s ones. People can still discuss in class, but it’s no longer mandatory for participation points.
            <br><br>
            Also, I would replace the long and boring articles and videos with some kind of open-source visual novel where one could pick their choice of topics and explore it at their rhythm, going back and forth if they need it. The information would be presented in a short and digestible way, with an optional mini game/quiz at the end of for those who want to test their knowledge. Students could also suggest their own ideas of topics and link their sources. If approved, their own topic would be added to the main menu. Of course, I would still add some general guidelines and verify the validity of each proposition, so people won’t just discuss something completely off-topic or false.
        </p>


        <h2>Week 6 - Intellectual Property</h2>

        <div class="question">
            You have been hired to an executive position in the software division of Omnicorp. In recent years, the creative computing lab at Conkers University has been the place where the most exciting new developments in software engineering are happening. The students there are doing brilliant research and coming up with dozens of amazing new innovations every year. The culture of the student community is strongly influenced by the Free Software movement, and all of its valuable output is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
            You must find a way for Omnicorp to profit from future student research at Conkers U. You have a $1 million CAD budget to achieve this goal, and will lose your job if shareholders do not see a strong return on this investment. The administration of Conkers U. is eager to welcome your donations and contributions to grants and scholarships, and to invite your experts to give career advice on how to succeed in the industry to their students.
            What is your strategy?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
          My strategy would be to convince the most talented students at Conkers University to join my company as researchers and programmers. I would use my budget to offer them scholarships and give them some paid internships. Technically anyone could watch a movie for free illegally on a streaming website, but then that means that the creators aren’t paid for their hard work. That would discourage them from producing new quality movies. They’re being taken advantage of by these consumers. People should respect intellectual property. It’s the same thing with software, what makes them so different from hardware that are rarely stolen? Their brilliant inventions shouldn’t just be offered for free and that a salaried employee is more motivated than a hobbyist to create high quality software. This is what my experts would explain to them.  
          <br><br> 
          To make the biggest profit possible, I would get inspired by companies such as Adobe or Microsoft Office and offer a subscription-based business where the students can keep using their current software, but that the new additions/improvements should be locked behind a paywall. I would then make advertisement for them and sell them to private companies as an essential software to use. For example, graphic designers often use Adobe software even if free options exist. Then, even if alternatives were to continue to be published, it is our software that will be the most popular. Basically, software should be turned into a Clubs Good, also known as an Artificially Scarce Good. 
          <p id="variableParagraph">Or I could just change job and refuse to indulge in corporate greed, lol.</p> 
        </p>

        <h2>Week 7 - Ideology and Identity</h2>

        <div class="question">
            After graduation, you get hired as a web designer for a successful tech company similar to the ones described in the readings. 
            One day, someone in management makes a mistake and you are given access to a document you shouldn’t have seen, which contains the list of all employees’ salaries. 
            You notice that for the same job position and level of experience, women employees are always paid less than men, on average 20% less. 
            Women represent about 25% of the entire company. 
            Who do you talk to about this? What do you do about the situation? How do you think your bosses will react to your actions?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>
            I would be quite upset by this and would talk about this with the other women employees of the company. We would check if our job conditions were exactly the same and document the differences on a written record. For example are the women and men working the same hours? Do they get performance-based pay (like commissions and bonuses) in addition to the hourly wage? What about the pregnancy and parental leaves? We would also verify the salary and work conditions of people of color, LGBTQ people and people with disabilities. If there is already a gap of salary between men and woman, it is likely that it is even worse for those who face multiple barriers. 
            <br><br>
            Then we would contact the bosses of the company to confront them about the issue as it is illegal to pay women less than men for the same job and experience. They’ll be embarrassed by this and would either make the necessary changes or do nothing at all and just fire us/tell us to change jobs. If the latter happens, I will use the media to get the news out to force change to happen. I would contact a journalist and tell them my story. I would also use social medias to share the events as this surely happens to a lot of women working in all kinds of fields. Sometimes, it’s by exposing a company that changes happens. Either way, I would probably sign some petitions, vote politicians who care about the issue and get some advice from organisms dedicated to social justice (feminism).
        </p>

        <h2>Week 8 - Hacker Culture</h2>

        <div class="question">
            It is the year 2025 and the COVID pandemic is ongoing due to a deadly new variant that mutated to be immune to all existing vaccines. 
            You are a hacker with a day job as a software technician for a university research lab which has been developing a new vaccine capable of 
            stopping this new variant and is almost done with trials. You are one of the people with access to the private server network where the vaccine 
            data is stored. The research is funded by Omnicorp, who will own the patent to the vaccine and fully control its distribution. The scientists who 
            performed the research are worried that poorer countries will not be able to afford Omnicorp's prices, and they believe the vaccine should be freely 
            available to everyone around the world as soon as it is confirmed safe. Do you help them? If so, how? If not, what do you tell them?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>Yes, I would definitely help them. It's by sharing the vaccine internationally that we will (mostly) eradicate the virus. 
            With my hacker knowledge, I would anonymously share all the information to the Internet on websites like WikiLeaks and wait for the medias to talk about this.
            I would also send this information to other scientists all over the world.
            However, I would have to be careful as we know that previous whistleblowers activists like Aaron Swartz, Chelsea Manning or Edward Snowden have been unfairly punished for sharing information
            without the government or the organisation's permission. If needed, I would have to seek asile at another country.</p>


        <h2>Week 9 - Commodification and Recuperation</h2>

        <div class="question">
            One day, you get “noticed” for your great opinions and personality, and your social media presence explodes overnight. You are now a minor e-celebrity: an influencer with a significant platform. 
            What does this change about your life? You receive an offer from Pepsi to subtly promote their soft drinks on your social media content in exchange for more money than you thought you’d ever see, 
            which you are free to spend however you like including donations to important causes, and Pepsi’s promotion will bring you an even bigger online following and larger platform. 
            How do you respond to this offer? Based on the issues brought up in the readings, how do you justify your choice to your fans and to your critics?
        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Answer</h3>
        <p>I would refuse this specific offer because of those two main reasons:
            <br><br>
            A)	I don’t want to become a tool to these corporate enterprises that only cares about making money and fakes caring about social issues. For example, in June, lots of big companies would ‘support’ LGBTQ+ people for Pride Month by changing their social media logo in rainbow but won’t actually do anything valuable to help them. It’s all for their public image. 
            That infamous advertisement by Pepsi was particularly egregious about using social issues to sell their products. I especially hate when companies like Walmart would ask you to donate for their foundation, like they have more than enough money to donate it themselves, they only want their charity tax credits. 
            <br><br>
            B)	I don’t even like Pepsi, nor do I enjoy any other kind of soft drinks. I would not promote something that I have no interest in. 
            As a minor e-celebrity, I’d rather keep my integrity and not have to promote a product I don't care about to get cash even though it might seem tempting. 
            After all, they are following me for my great opinions and personality, so I would make sure to keep my personality 'authentic'. Perhaps, by explaining my reasoning, I would even gain some more fans (perhaps less than with Pepsi's help, but they'll probably be more loyal and engage with me more regularly) 
            While it is true that commodification have became the norm on Internet, there are actually many other ways of gaining money like Patreon, or just
            generalised advertisement on Youtube where I don't have to directly promote something.
            <br><br>
            However, if this offer came from a brand or an organisation that I actually like (example: a clothing brand I often shop at and genuinely like or a foundation with a cause I care about) then, maybe I would consider it.
